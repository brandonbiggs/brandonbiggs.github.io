This is my first blog post. I wanted to see what something like this would be like. If I enjoy it, I'll try to write more often, hopefully around once every week or two. I really just need to figure out interesting things to write about. My wife says my Twitter is really boring and nerdy and that's where I write the most... so she'll probably think this is boring and nerdy too...
